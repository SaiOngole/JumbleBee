Date:   Mon Oct 31 16:19:13 2011 +0530

     The idea for increasing the number of words is to have three statements
     generating random numbers.
     Switching between them can be done by using a counter with a limit of
     approx 10.

    Score count also provided and the app closes well.
    No bugs so far.
    Major thing that is left is to jumble the words and have more number of
    words.
    Minor changes like the background, text, etc also need to be done.
