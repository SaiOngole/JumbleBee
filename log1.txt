    Finally the code jumbles by itself and it does so effectively!
    Done with the major part of the application only left with increasing the
    number of words, changing the icon and the background :)

    Added 65 new words to the data base.
    Gotta enter a lot more words approx 1000 and then write the code for
    automated jumbling of the words.
    Only this is the major part of the program.
    Minor ones are finding a nice back ground, custom button and icon

     The idea for increasing the number of words is to have three statements
     generating random numbers.
     Switching between them can be done by using a counter with a limit of
     approx 10.

    Score count also provided and the app closes well.
    No bugs so far.
    Major thing that is left is to jumble the words and have more number of
    words.
    Minor changes like the background, text, etc also need to be done.
